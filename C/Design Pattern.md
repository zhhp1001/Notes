# Design Pattern



## Structural patterns



### Adapter

### Decorator

Since all decorators implement the same interface as the base notifier, the rest of the client code won’t care whether it works with the “pure” notifier object or the decorated one.

### Bridge

### Proxy



## Behavioral patterns



### Observer

### Strategy

### Template Method

### Chain of Responsibility

### Iterator

### State
