# What do Linkers Do?



## Step 1: Symbol resolution



## Step2: Relocation

- Merges separate code and data sections into single sections
- Relocates symbols from their relative locations in the `.o` files to **their final absolute memory locations in the executable**.
- Updates all references to these symbols to reflect their new positions.
