# VsCode 

## cannot edit in read-only editor

The default settings in vscode is a non-editable document. It acts as a way for you to view the default settings for native settings as well as extension default settings.

These defaults are also used to identify when a setting has changed with a 'blue' line indicator, when using the [settings editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-editor):

> Changes to settings are reloaded by VS Code as you change them. Modified settings are now indicated with a blue line similar to modified lines in the editor. The gear icon opens a context menu with options to reset the setting to its default value as well as copy setting as JSON.

Currently, vscode only offers 2 editable settings:

> VS Code provides two different scopes for settings:
>
> - User Settings - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.
> - Workspace Settings - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.
>
> Workspace settings override user settings. Workspace settings are specific to a project and can be shared across developers on a project.
>
> > Note: A VS Code "workspace" is usually just your project root folder. Workspace settings as well as debugging and task configurations are stored at the root in a .vscode folder. You can also have more than one root folder in a VS Code workspace through a feature called Multi-root workspaces.

Edit your `settings.json` by:

```bash
File -> Preferences -> Settings
```
