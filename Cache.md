# Cache

A valid bit that indicates whether or not the block contains meaningful information, and t = m - (b + s) tag bits (a subset of the bits from current block's memory address) that uniquely identify the block stored in the cache line.



## Direct-Mapped Caches

A cache with exactly one line per set (E=1) is known as a direct-mapped cache.



The process that a cache goes through of determining whether a request is a hit or a miss and then extracting the requested word consists of three steps:

1. set selection
2. line matching
3. word extraction



Thrashing conflict miss
